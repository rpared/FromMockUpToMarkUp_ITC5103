Due Date: Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:59 p.m.
Submit all files in a zipped folder to Blackboard: YourName.zip. 
Guidelines and description (read the following criteria very carefully): 
For this exercise, you will create a web page for the International Association of Business
Communicators (IABC) based on the provided mockup image (see below on page 2). This 
exercise will test your ability to build with HTML using semantically appropriate elements,
and style them with CSS. Completing this exercise will demonstrate your working knowledge
of the information and skills gained in lessons and labs so far.
• All of the images and text that you will need can be found inside the exercise folder.
• Note: some of the images may need to be resized with CSS to match the mockup.
• Start from scratch with a blank TEMPLATE.html file, and the provided CSS file.
• You do not need to add working hyperlinks to any elements in this exercise, however, note
the CONTACT link in the mockup. That is what the navigation items should look like
when the mouse moves over a menu item.
• Be sure to use the helper tools shown in class: the browser Developer Tools, and the W3C
Validators for HTML & CSS.
